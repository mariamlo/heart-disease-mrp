Early Detection of Heart Disease: A Machine Learning Approach Using CDC Health Indicators

This project aims to develop a machine learning-based risk assessment model for predicting heart disease using the 2022 CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset. The study explores relationships between various personal health indicators and cardiovascular risk, identifies key predictors, and evaluates the performance of several machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost).
