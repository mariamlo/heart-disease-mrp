## Early Detection of Heart Disease: A Machine Learning Approach Using CDC Health Indicators

This project aims to develop a machine learning-based risk assessment model for predicting heart disease using the 2022 CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset. The study explores the relationships between personal health indicators and cardiovascular risk, identifies key predictive features, and evaluates the performance of several classification models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and XGBoost.
